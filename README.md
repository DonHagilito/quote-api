# Quotes API - small back-end project

This is a small project called Quotes API from Codecademy.com. 
In this project I was given a finished front-end website and database and had to add my own back-end to it to make it work. 

I was given instructions on what data should be supplied for different routes then added my own routing logic for it to work.

My own work is in the file: **server.js**

## How to test the API
You need to have a terminal with Node.js and NPM installed.
1. Download the repository to your own computer. 
2. Use a terminal and navigate to the folder of the repository.
3. Enter **npm install** into the terminal to install the modules used in the project.
4. Enter **node server.js** into the terminal.
5. Enter **localhost:4001** in the URL of your web-browser. 
6. Try the functionality on the website presented.
